This API runs with private key on a nodeJS and Express server, doesn't do anything in DOM yet, probably going to play with API in a different language.

They have a lot of cool ones https://api.nasa.gov/#:~:text=old%20API%20key-,Browse%20APIs,-Search%20big :D

The express server runs just fine on port 3000 if you run 'node index.js' or npm run dev', see package.json
